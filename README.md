## Before you start

The test is based on [Google Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit) v0.6.5

Follow [installation instructions](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/blob/v0.6.5/docs/install.md) and read [commands](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/blob/v0.6.5/docs/commands.md) documentation to set up developer tools. You should end with a working test page on http://localhost:3000/.
